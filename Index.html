		<h1>WHAT  WE  DO  AT  REBIRTH </h1>
		</br>
		Rebirth allows you to practice yoga on a floating platform while enjoying the 
beauty of nature- the sky above, the ocean below, and peace within. The 
purpose of yoga is to build strength, awareness and harmony in both the mind 
and body. Yoga also provides a retreat from the chaotic and busy lives. Yoga 
develops inner awareness. Yoga reduces the tension and stress in the mind and 
body and we at rebirth try to bring all these benefits of yoga to you in a more
calm and comfortable manner.
